✅ Option 1: Force the browser to load the latest CSS
Add a cache buster to the end of your CSS link in the HTML file:

html
Copy
Edit
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/css/add.css?v=<?= time() ?>">
✅ This "?v=timestamp" trick fools the browser into thinking it's a new file, so it loads the latest version every time.
